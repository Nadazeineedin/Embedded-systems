<h1> Project description: </h1>
This project simulates a batch mixing system using a PIC16F84A microcontroller. The system can operate in three different modes, which are controlled by a selector switch. Each mode mixes different proportions of fluids A, B, and C. The system also includes a mixer, a heater, and pumps to control the flow of the fluids.

<h3> Key features: </h3>
Three mixing modes: Mode A: Mixes fluids A and B at a 1:1 ratio. Mode B: Mixes fluids A and B at a 2:1 ratio. Mode C: Mixes fluids A, B, and C at a 1:1:1 ratio. Controlled by a PIC16F84A microcontroller. Includes a mixer, a heater, and pumps. Has a start/stop button and a run/idle indicator.

Hardware components:

PIC16F84A microcontroller 10 MHz oscillator Three pumps with flow rates of 60, 45, and 90 L/min Tank with a capacity of 180 L Selector switch Mixer Heater Software:
